                    <ul>
                        <li><mark>Create a small park</mark> in an area where its space is narrow for building rides and wide for constructing pathways.</li>
                        <li>Visitors can greatly enjoy the thrill of dropping from a high place 
                            <mark>if a tunnel is built in front of the descending point.</mark></li>
                        <li>To reduce the number of visitors who feel nauseous, 
                            <mark>benches, fountains or trees should be strategically placed</mark> in front of the exit of rides like roller coasters.</li>
