                <h2>History of the Game</h2>
                <p>
                    This game was first released in North America on March 22, 1999.
                    <br><br>
                    :: Expansion Packs ::<br>
                    Two expansion packs were released, each including new rides, facilities, and scenarios.
                    The first pack, called <mark>Added Attractions</mark>, was released in 1999, 
                    and the second pack, <mark>Loopy Landscapes</mark>, was released in 2000.
                    <br><br>
                    :: Re-releases ::<br>
                    In 2001, a version called <mark>Totally RollerCoaster</mark> was released, 
                    which included the base game and the Loopy Landscapes on separate discs.
                    <br>
                    In 2002, <mark>RollerCoaster Tycoon Gold</mark> was released, bundling the base game and both expansion packs together.
                    <br>
                    In 2003, it was re-released as <mark>RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe</mark>. 
                    Deluxe was later made available on digital distribution platforms such as Steam.

                <h2>Tips and Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><mark>Create a small park</mark> in an area where its space is narrow for building rides and wide for constructing pathways.</li>
                        <li>Visitors can greatly enjoy the thrill of dropping from a high place 
                            <mark>if a tunnel is built in front of the descending point.</mark></li>
                        <li>To reduce the number of visitors who feel nauseous, 
                            <mark>benches, fountains or trees should be strategically placed</mark> in front of the exit of rides like roller coasters.</li>
